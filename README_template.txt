METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------
# Methods for a dataset should focus on all aspects of dataset production and should be thorough enough for your work to be reproduced. Include descriptions of the experimental design, laboratory and/or field collection methods (e.g., observations and/or devices used), source data for synthesis studies, data processing, and QA/QC procedures, and known issues or limitations of data where applicable. A complete methods section will improve findability of your data, as all text entered into methods will also be searchable for users through the data portal filters. 

# You may provide a citation for any methods used that were published previously, but methods related to data production must still be included.

#
# Software: If specialized software(s) generated your data or
# are necessary to interpret it, please provide for each (if
# applicable): software name, version, system requirements,
