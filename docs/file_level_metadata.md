The following components are needed to describe each attribute:

A name (often the column or row header in the file). Like file names, only letters, numbers, hyphens (“-“), and underscores (“_”) should be used in attribute names. Always avoid using spaces and specialized ASCII characters when naming attributes.
A complete definition. The definition should fully clarify the measurement to a broad scientific audience. For example, a definition like “%C” may always be interpreted within a certain discipline in a uniform way. However, it might always be interpreted within another certain discipline in a different uniform way. A full technical definition such as “percent soil carbon by dry soil mass” helps to limit possible confusion.
Any missing value codes along with explanations for those codes (e.g.: “-999 = instrument malfunction”, “NA = site not found”).
For all numeric data, unit information is needed (e.g.: meters, kelvin, etc.). If your unit is not found in the standard unit list, please select “Other / None” and we will change this to the appropriate custom unit.
For all date-time data, a date-time format is needed (e.g.: “YYYY-MM-DD”).
For all spatial data, the spatial reference system details are needed.
For text data, full descriptions for all patterns/codes are needed if the text is constrained to a list of patterns or codes (e.g. a phone number would be constrained to a certain pattern and abbreviations for site locations may be constrained to a list of codes).


o	Metadata that describe the data files 
	The portal will prompt you to describe your variates. For each column of each table, please provide the attribute name (as used on the table), attribute label  (a descriptive display name, e.g. Temp_p2 = Temperature, probe 2), an attribute definition (unformatted text), a missing value indicator, a category type, and units of measurement, if applicable. 
	Alternatively, if your data has a significant number of columns, it is acceptable to include a document or spreadsheet that outlines the variable descriptions. This should, at minimum, include:
•	Column names, units of measurements, attribute definition, categorical descriptions, and the missing value codes/indicator descriptions.
