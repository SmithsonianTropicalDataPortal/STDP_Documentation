The following components are needed to describe each attribute:

A name (often the column or row header in the file). Like file names, only letters, numbers, hyphens (“-“), and underscores (“_”) should be used in attribute names. Always avoid using spaces and specialized ASCII characters when naming attributes.
A complete definition. The definition should fully clarify the measurement to a broad scientific audience. For example, a definition like “%C” may always be interpreted within a certain discipline in a uniform way. However, it might always be interpreted within another certain discipline in a different uniform way. A full technical definition such as “percent soil carbon by dry soil mass” helps to limit possible confusion.
Any missing value codes along with explanations for those codes (e.g.: “-999 = instrument malfunction”, “NA = site not found”).
For all numeric data, unit information is needed (e.g.: meters, kelvin, etc.). If your unit is not found in the standard unit list, please select “Other / None” and we will change this to the appropriate custom unit.
For all date-time data, a date-time format is needed (e.g.: “YYYY-MM-DD”).
For all spatial data, the spatial reference system details are needed.
For text data, full descriptions for all patterns/codes are needed if the text is constrained to a list of patterns or codes (e.g. a phone number would be constrained to a certain pattern and abbreviations for site locations may be constrained to a list of codes).
