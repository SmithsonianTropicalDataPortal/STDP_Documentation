## **Mission** 
The mission of the Smithsonian Tropical Data Portal is to help the international community preserve, share, and discover tropical data and other research products including protocols, code, reports, and presentations. We aim to help make past, current, and future tropical datasets accessible by providing resources for documentation, management, storage, and visualization of tropical research data. The Smithsonian Tropical Data Portal is supported by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and Smithsonian Research Computing, and was made possible by a generous gift from Dr. Stephen Quake and the Wallace Line Fund.
