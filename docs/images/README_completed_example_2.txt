Note: All individuals in the 50-ha plot larger than the listed species-specific minimum diameter breast height (DBH) thresholds were visited. The proportionfemale is given with binomial confidence intervals. Logistic regressions were used to estimate the relation between DBH and species-specific reproductive probability (combining males and females). Estimated coefficients (51 SE) are given; larger trees are significantly more likely to be reproductive in all species.Bruijning_2017_table_2.pdf: Table 2 as it was presented in the article.Geographic Location---------------------Barro Colorado Island, PanamaNorthwest CoordinatesLat: 9.179793057228403Long: -79.87191537940562Southeast CoordinatesLat: 9.132262269654667Long: -79.81748861392951Methods---------------------The methods are described in: Surviving in a Cosexual World: A Cost-Benefit Analysis of Dioecy in Tropical TreesMarjolein Bruijning, Marco D.
