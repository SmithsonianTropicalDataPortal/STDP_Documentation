# Frequently Asked Questions
## General Questions
### Will you take my data?
In short, yes. The mission of the Smithsonian Tropical Data Portal is to help the international community preserve, share, and discover tropical data and other research products including protocols, code, reports, and presentations. We aim to help make past, current, and future tropical datasets accessible by providing resources for documentation, management, storage, and visualization of tropical research data. 

### How do I create an account with STDP to upload data?
Check out our [User Registration](/register_to_submit/) help documentation to get started with uploads.

### I'm having trouble logging in with my ORCID.
If login is not working, please try one or all of our [login troubleshooting tips](/login_troubleshooting/). Contact `WhiteA@si.edu` or `BrissetteL@si.edi` if problems persist.

## Search FAQ
### Why can’t I see all the Smithsonian Figshare historical data here?
STDP is working on the transition of historical tropical data from <a href="https://smithsonian.figshare.com" target="_blank">Smithsonian Figshare</a>to the STDP. Smithsonian Figshare is still active and while the current plan is to have all newly published tropical research data avaiable through the STDP, the transition will be a gradual one. If you have any questions about the Smithsonian Research Data Repository, the Smithsonian Tropical Data Portal,  or the data transition, please contact `WhiteA@is.edu`.

### Why can’t I see the data I uploaded in the dataset listing?
Check if you are logged in. If you haven’t Published your dataset, then it will only be visible, privately to you, once you are logged in.

What metadata do you need to submit a dataset?
We need metadata about what the dataset is about (e.g. title, description, keywords, funding), its association to a DOE project, and author information. Check out this page to preview the submission form to get a sense of the types of metadata a dataset needs. 

To understand ESS-DIVE's expectations for metadata content, see our Package Level Metadata Guide for details.

What if I want to practice uploading data first?
Please visit https://data-sandbox.ess-dive.lbl.gov to test the ESS-DIVE system and play around with the upload process. Any data that you save in the test system is temporary, and will not be preserved in ESS-DIVE. You do not need to request permission to upload data to ESS-DIVE before using sandbox.

What happens after I submit the data?
The dataset will be entered into the ESS-DIVE system, and will only be visible to you privately until you Publish the data. You can continue to Edit the record after you submit.

What happens after I publish the data?
An ESS-DIVE admin will review the record and respond to you by email. The record will not be published until you respond to the email from the ESS-DIVE admin. If you specified an existing DOI, we will publish the data with the same DOI, otherwise the record will be published with a new DOI.

What if my data upload is failing?
Uploading large amounts of data can be really difficult on home internet connections. We recommend taking the following steps: 

Upload files one at a time and save after each upload is complete to ensure that the changes are properly saved.

Go to your computer’s battery settings and turn off sleep mode. If your system goes to sleep in the middle of an upload it can stop the process and prevent the changes from saving.

Please contact ess-dive-support@lbl.gov should the upload issue persist.

Additionally, you may want to consider using Globus to workaround upload errors. Globus is a third-party data transfer tool that ESS-DIVE commonly uses to support large or difficult file uploads. Learn more on our Globus documentation page:
