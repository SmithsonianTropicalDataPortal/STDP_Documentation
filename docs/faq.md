# Frequently Asked Questions
## General Questions
### Will you take my data?
In short, yes. The mission of the Smithsonian Tropical Data Portal is to help the international community preserve, share, and discover tropical data and other research products including protocols, code, reports, and presentations. We aim to help make past, current, and future tropical datasets accessible by providing resources for documentation, management, storage, and visualization of tropical research data. 

### How do I create an account with STDP to upload data?
Check out our [User Registration](/register_to_submit/) help documentation to get started with uploads.

### I'm having trouble logging in with my ORCID.
If login is not working, please try one or all of our [login troubleshooting tips](/login_troubleshooting/). Contact `WhiteA@si.edu` or `BrissetteL@si.edi` if problems persist.

### What is a Data Package?
The Smithsonian Research Data Repository primarily archives data packages. Data packages are simply defined as a collection of related data and metadata files. Each data package should contain, when possible, all of the relevant data and metadata from a specific research project (or sub-project/project component). Depending on the size of a research project, multiple data packages may be associated with a single research project. 

For example, if a research project consists of field sampling at several distinct sites or over several distinct sampling seasons, each site/season may have its own unique data package. When submitting to the Smithsonian Tropical Data Portal, it is up to the best judgement of the submitting researcher how their research should be grouped.

## Search FAQ
### Why can’t I see all the Smithsonian Figshare historical data here?
STDP is working on the transition of historical tropical data from <a href="https://smithsonian.figshare.com" target="_blank">Smithsonian Figshare</a> to the STDP. Smithsonian Figshare is still active and while the current plan is to have all newly published tropical research data avaiable through the STDP, the transition will be a gradual one. If you have any questions about the Smithsonian Research Data Repository, the Smithsonian Tropical Data Portal,  or the data transition, please contact `WhiteA@is.edu`.

### Why can’t I see the data I uploaded in the dataset listing?
Check if you are logged in. If you haven’t Published your dataset, then it will only be visible, privately to you, once you are logged in.

## Upload FAQ
## What is a good dataset?
To see an example of a good dataset, visit these packages on STDP:

If you would like to reference other datasets that have been reviewed and published in the STDP, visit https://smithsonian.dataone/data and explore the list of published datasets.

### What metadata do you need to submit a dataset?
We need metadata about what the dataset is about (e.g. title, description, keywords, funding), and author information. Check out [this page](/submit_online/) to preview the submission form to get a sense of the types of metadata a dataset needs. 

To understand the Smithsonian Tropical Data Portal's expectations for metadata content, see our [Package Level Metadata Guide](/package_level_meta_reqs/) for details.

### What happens after I "Save Dataset"?
The dataset will be entered into the STDP system, and will only be visible to you, and those that you share the data package with, privately until you [Publish](/submit_online/#publication_options/) the data. You can continue to Edit the record after you submit.

### What are my data package publication options?
Please review the [publication options](/submit_online/#publication-options) to make your new or previously existing dataset(s) and/or metadata publications available through the Smithsonian Tropical Data Portal. If you have any questions regarding the process, please feel free to reach out to `BrissetteL@si.edu`

### What if my data upload is failing?
Uploading large amounts of data can be really difficult on home internet connections. We recommend taking the following steps: 

* Upload files one at a time and save after each upload is complete to ensure that the changes are properly saved.

* Go to your computer’s battery settings and turn off sleep mode. If your system goes to sleep in the middle of an upload it can stop the process and prevent the changes from saving.

* Please contact ess-dive-support@lbl.gov should the upload issue persist.

* Additionally, you may want to consider using Globus to workaround upload errors. Globus is a third-party data transfer tool that ESS-DIVE commonly uses to support large or difficult file uploads. Learn more on our <a href="https://smithsonian.dataone.org/portals/tropical/Globus" target="_blank">Globus documentation page</a>.
