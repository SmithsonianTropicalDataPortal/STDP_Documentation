Column Name,Category,Definition
SampleType,Leaf,"Flat organ primarily involved in photosynthesis. Note: This campaign specifically targeted collection of distinctively colored young leaves, so these measurements should not be considered typical of mature laves."
SampleType,Bark,Outermost layer of stems of woody plants.
SampleType,Fruit,"The plant dispersal units post-fertilization, including fruits and seeds and nuts.  "
SampleType,Flower,"The seed-bearing part of a plant, consisting of reproductive organs (stamens and carpels) that are usually surrounded by brightly colored petals and sepals."
SampleType,Seed,"A flowering plant's unit of reproduction. For sample collection, usually grouped with other diaspore structures as fruit."
SampleState,Mature,Samples that are fully developed and capable of fertilization (flowers) or germination. Identified by correct structure and color and a lack of wilting and decay.
SampleState,Immature,Samples that are still in development and are not fully capable of reproduction. Usually smaller or lack full structural development and may be a different color.
SampleState,Senescent,Samples that are past the prime stage and show signs of general deterioration (wilting/discoloration/decay). Samples showing early signs of senescing were collected at times (although mature samples were preferred); fully senescent and decaying samples were avoided.
MeasurementType,contact,Spectral reflectance reading is taken with full contact and pressure applied between the contact probe and the sample (to obtain stronger readings).
MeasurementType,near-contact,Spectral reflectance reading is taken with a 5-15mm distance between the contact probe and the sample or the white reference plate (to maintain sample structure).
MeasurementType,leaf-clip,Spectral reflectance readings are measured using the leaf clip accessory.
ViewType,adaxial,Upper surface of a leaf.
ViewType,abaxial,Lower surface of a leaf.
ViewType,interior,The inner surface of a sample that may be enclosed during organ development but becomes exposed during maturing (the inside surface of a seed capsule/center of a flower).
ViewType,exterior,The outer surface of an organ (outside surface of a seed capsule; flower sepals; or outer petals.)
ViewType,aril,"Fleshy envelope of seed, usually brightly colored."
ViewType,capsule,Fruit–usually dry– that opens when ripe to release seeds.
ViewType,single,A single leaf measured on the adaxial (upper) surface.
ViewType,stacked,A stack of three leaves measured together on the adaxial (upper) surface.
ViewType,pericarp seed,Refers to the outer layer of a seed that is often part of the fruit wall that develops from the ovary after fertilization.
ViewType,wing,A wing-like extension of a fruit that is typically aiding in wind dispersal.
